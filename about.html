    <p> I love to travel on the land or in the air with the people. </p>
    <p>I love because when I am with them our journey becomes more fun while enjoying the beautiful environment and scenery. </p> 
   <p> Because of this, we will further strengthen our organization as a family by sharing the story of our lives, and consequently relentless storytelling while on the trip and until we reach our destination. </p> 
   <p>One of the things that I want to be with is my friends that I met as I went through the life of a student because I was also with them through the hardships and joys of our student life. </p>
   <p> Because I'm not the person that enjoying life alone.</p>
   <p> I try it before and I don't like the feeling of it and someday if that time will come that I will be alone I hope that I can do it.</p>
